    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Very often programming is about shuffling data in and out of different tools, converting one data format to another, extracting numerical data from a text, and administering numerical experiments involving a large number of data files and directories.  Such tasks are much faster to accomplish in a language like Python than in Fortran, C, C++, C#, or Java\n",

    "[Foster Provost](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/fprovost/), co-author of [Data Science for Business](http://data-science-for-biz.com/), describes why Python is such a useful programming language for practical data science in [Python: A Practical Tool for Data Science](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1p6vowsEuiezLbWnFKgse70a8LxfsrRixqPF5nBg8F3A), :\n",

    "> The practice of data science involves many interrelated but different activities, including accessing data, manipulating data, computing statistics about data, plotting/graphing/visualizing data, building predictive and explanatory models from data, evaluating those models on yet more data, integrating models into production systems, etc. One option for the data scientist is to learn several different software packages that each specialize in one or two of these things, but don’t do them all well, plus learn a programming language to tie them together. (Or do a lot of manual work.)  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> An alternative is to use a general-purpose, high-level programming language that provides libraries to do all these things. Python is an excellent choice for this. It has a diverse range of open source libraries for just about everything the data scientist will do. It is available everywhere; high performance python interpreters exist for running your code on almost any operating system or architecture. Python and most of its libraries are both open source and free. Contrast this with common software packages that are available in a course via an academic license, yet are extremely expensive to license and use in industry.\n",

Both fields are concerned with the analysis of data to find useful or informative patterns.

Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out some of the differences to give perspective.\n",

    "> \n",
    ">Historically, KDD spun off from Machine Learning as a research field focused on concerns raised by examining real-world applications, and a decade and a half later the KDD community remains more concerned with applications than Machine Learning is. As such, research focused on commercial applications and business issues of data analysis tends to gravitate toward the KDD community rather than to Machine Learning. KDD also tends to be more concerned with the entire process of data analytics: data preparation, model learning, evaluation, and so on.\n"

    "For more on the topic, I recommend a very well documented IPython Notebook, which includes numerous helpful examples and links, by [Sebastian Raschka](http://sebastianraschka.com/), [Key differences between Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb), the [Cheat Sheet: Writing Python 2-3 compatible code](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html) by Ed Schofield ... or [googling Python 2 vs 3](https://www.google.com/q=python%202%20vs%203).\n",

    "[Nick Coghlan](https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev), a CPython core developer, sent me an email suggesting that relatively minor changes in this notebook would enable it to run with Python 2 *or* Python 3: importing the `print_function` from the  [**`__future__`**](https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html) module, and changing my [`print` *statements* (Python 2)](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#print) to [`print` *function calls* (Python 3)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print). Although a relatively minor conceptual change, it necessitated the changing of many individual cells to reflect the Python 3 `print` syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to import the `division` module from the `future`, as I find [the use of `/` for \"true division\"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/) - and the use of `//` for \"floor division\" - to be more aligned with my intuition. I also needed to replace a few functions that are no longer available in Python 3 with related functions that are available in both versions; I've added notes in nearby cells where the incompatible functions were removed explaining why they are related ... and no longer available.

Each path from the root to a leaf can also be represented as a classification rule.\n",

Tests for such variables typically use comparison operators, e.g., $age < 65$ or $36,250 < adjusted\\_gross\\_income <= 87,850$. *[Aside: Python supports boolean expressions containing multiple comparison operators, such as the expression comparing adjusted_gross_income in the preceding example.]*\n",

There is no mechanism for *private* class members, but identifiers with leading double underscores (*\\_\\_member_identifier*) are 'mangled' (translated into *\\_class_name\\__member_identifier*), and thus not directly accessible outside their class, and can be used to approximate private members by Python programmers. \n",
